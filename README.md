# ParticleWorkshop

I have been wanting to create a complete version of my particle simulator to make my ideas come to life.
The two predecessors to this project where written in Python and C++, but had no interface and very poor performance considering what they could accomplish. This project is an attempt to fix that, with my very first user-friendly graphical editor and GPU accelerated simulations.
This is still in very, very early development (yeah, there are no simulation yet, only an editor...), but I intend to add as many features to the project as I can during my everyday free time.

## Why am I using Java and JavaFX?

Cuz I've got to use those for a class and I figured it would be a decent way to practice

## Is the code good?

Trying my best, can't certify they're the best practices in Java though. And since it's still in development, there's a lot of cleaning up to do :)

## Why isn't the artwork good?

Anyway, lovely to see you... Bye now
